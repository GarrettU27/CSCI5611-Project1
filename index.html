    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      This is my website submission for Project 1, Part 2 in CSCI 5611. The
      final project can be viewed in the video below.
    </p>

    <h1>Features</h1>
    <h2>Space Theme</h2>
    <p>
      As I was working on the simulation, the agents carefully navigating around
      the obstacles reminded me of that scene where Han Solo is flying through
      the asteroid field in Star Wars. So, I decided to style my project to have
      a space theme. The moving agents are space ships, the bounding geometries
      of the space ships are force fields, the obstacles are asteroids, their
      bounding geometries are little "atmospheres" and the nodes in the PRM are
      stars. This theme can be seen throughout the entire video.
    </p>
    <h2>Smarter Obstacle Placement</h2>
    <p>
      When the obstacles are being generated, they actively check whether they
      intersect any other obstacle. This results in no obstacles overlapping
      each other. This can be seen throughout the video (the spinning asteroids
      are the obstacles).
    </p>
    <h2>Natural Movement</h2>
    <p>
      Space ships have a maximum velocity and maximum acceleration that they can
      undertake. Further, they slow down near corners and near the goal for a
      more natural look. Finally, the space ships will also speed up whenever
      they aren't near a corner. At the start, you can see the green space ship
      demonstrate it pretty well. It starts moving, gets up to speed, but then
      slows down as it approaches the corner. It's supposed to look like they're
      carefully navigating tight corners in a densely packed asteroid field, so
      I thought it looked better to have them slow a little when turning, rather
      than drifting around corners.
    </p>
    <h2>Multiple Agents</h2>
    <p>
      I decided that it would be fun to have multiple space ships in the
      simulation rather than just one, so I made it so my simulation can render
      an arbitrary number of agents, each with their own path. Right now, this
      is set to have 10 agents, but I could set it to have 20, 30, etc. and it
      would work without much configuration. I just thought that 10 looked the
      best.
    </p>
    <h2>Rotating Assets</h2>
    <p>
      I thought it looked weird for the space ships to always sit in the same
      rotation while it flew, so I made the space ships rotate so that the tip
      of the ship is always pointing the direction it's travelling. I also
      thought it looked weird for the asteroids to just be sitting around
      statically, so I gave each asteroid a random rotation.
    </p>
    <h2>Path Smoothing</h2>
    <p>
      This simulation works by generating a Probabilistic Road Map (PRM), then
      running A* on that map to determine the optimal path between two points.
      But, even though the generated path is optimal for the PRM, it is not
      optimal for the actual 2D envrionment the space ships move through.
      Instead of following the path point to point, which could result in a
      strange, jagged looking movement, the space ship instead finds the
      furthest node that it can see and travels to that. The colored lines show
      the calculated path, and, as you can see, the space ships don't always
      follow it perfectly. They take shortcuts to make the path shorter and
      round off jagged turns. A great example of this is the purple space ship
      at 0:06 in the video. It cuts to the left and completely avoids going
      around those two outer asteroids.
    </p>

    <h1>Project Features I Attempted</h1>
    <h2>Single Agent Navigation</h2>
    <p>
      Obviously, this one is required. The rockets are all navigating a
      cluttered, 2D environment. I use a PRM with A* to calculate the path, and
      then smooth the path as the space ships simulate the movement. I also cap
      the velocity and acceleration of the space ship at certain limits to make
      the movement look natural. Slow downs near corners also help make the
      movement look natural.
    </p>
    <h2>Improved Agent and Scene Rendering</h2>
    <p>
      I themed all the agents as space ships by using textured quads. I also
      rendered the obstacles as asteroids using textured quads. However, they
      have bounding spheres which are used for the collision and pathfinding
      calculations. These are also displayed in the simulation. The bounding
      geometry for the spaceship is the little force field around it and the
      bounding geometry for the asteroid is the little atmosphere around it
      (both are colored, transparent cirlces overlayed on top of the quad).
    </p>
    <h2>Orientation Smoothing</h2>
    <p>
      The agents are rendered as space ships and have a clear front and back.
      The front of the space ship (the nose of the rocket) is supposed to be
      pointing in the same direction the ship is moving, so it looks more like
      an actual rocket moving through space. The acceleartion and velocity
      calculations from before result in smooth rotations of the agent, even if
      they can sometimes be fast.
    </p>
    <h2>Multiple Agents Planning</h2>
    <p>
      My simulation can support an arbitrary number of agents, though the
      example video is rendered with 10. They all get their own start positions
      and end goals, which they all plan separate paths for and then move to
      independently. I did not attempt the Crowd Simulation challenge, however,
      so the agents do not make an attempt to avoid each other.
    </p>

    <h1>Code</h1>
    <p>
      The simulation was written using
      <a href="https://processing.org/">processing</a> and
      <a
        href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/PriorityQueue.html"
        >PriorityQueue</a
      >
      from the <a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Java</a> standard library. The
      test harness for this project was used as a base for creating the
      simulation, but it has been significantly modified. Almost none of the
      original code of the test harness remains.

    <h1>Difficulties</h1>
    <h2>A* With Arbitrary Start and Goal Positions</h2>
    <p>
      Implementing A* normally was not too problematic for me. You just roughly
      follow the pseudo code with your own logic and you end up with the proper
      results. But, the arbitrary start and goal positions meant that I had to
      slighly modify A* to get the results I wanted. While you can just add the
      start and goal positions as nodes in the PRM, and then re-generate the
      connections for the graph, that is really slow, and was not fast enough
      for the speeds required for this simulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, my solution to get A* to work ultimately looked like the
      following. First, determine all the nodes that could be a neighbor of the
      start, and add them to the fringe (open set in A*). These nodes had to
      have the cost for going from the start to them added on initially, as
      well. Basically, instead of starting the algorithm with one node, we start
      the algorithm like we're already one step in, and we start with several
      nodes. Second, determine all the nodes that could be a neighbor of the
      goal and add them to a list of goal nodes. Third, whenever a goal node is
      encountered, add a node to the fringe with the proper cost to go to the
      goal, and an ID that marks it as the goal node. Finally, whenever a node
      is pulled off the fringe with the goal node ID, end the algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, this works basically the same as how A* runs normally, but I
      avoided creating new nodes for the start and goal and regenerating all the
      edges in the graph. This sort of solution was kind of discussed in class,
      but even with the class discussion and my own understanding of the
      solution, it still took a while to debug and get it working.
    </p>
    <h2>Smooth and Collision Free Motion</h2>
    <p>
      Simulating smooth motion was not too difficult, as that is something we've
      covered in class and in class activities before. However, smooth, weighty
      motion that looks good is not very good at following a path. An agent with
      that sort of motion frequently overshoots corners, is forced to back track
      and hits obstacles. It took a lot of work and tinkering to figure out how
      to make motion that looks good and natural while still following the path
      for the most part. Ultimately, the fix that helped the most in making it
      happen was forcing the agent to slow to some minimum velocity when it
      reached corners. Thus, it could still have weighty movement, but it
      couldn't overshoot corners, which was the main problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was also issues with the agent fidgeting and jiggling sporadically
      and randomly, but forcing the acceleration to be over some minimum amount
      and changing the renderer from the default to P2D fixed up most of those
      issues.
